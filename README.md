### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

You can run the development server, queue worker, and Vite bundler all at once with the custom `dev` script.

```

Alternatively, you can run the Laravel development server and Vite separately:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **In a new terminal, start the Laravel server:**
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## üß™ Running Tests

To run the automated test suite for the application, use the following Artisan command:

```bash
composer run test
```
This will clear any cached configurations and then execute the PHPUnit tests.
